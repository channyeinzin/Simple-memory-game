**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Chan Nyein Zin**

Time spent: **15** hours spent in total

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions


1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
I followed the SITE Program Pre-work instruction from the CodePath course, and I did not look at any outside sources or a person's help. 

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? 
It is a beneficial game for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript beginners. However, if we do not have any idea of building a small project, we should try this project. The most challenging part of this program is making a timer object and would have it run a function that counts down a specific timer variable. However, I followed the step that the code path provided to me, and I read carefully and followed the code path's explanation. Then the next challenging part is recalling the functions within the three languages because they need to connect in this game. Another challenging part was creating the gif because I had never done that before, and it took me more than an hour because I had to resize my video time limit and resolution within 10MB. I had to be patient and record multiple times to get the perfect narrative, and I followed the explanation steps from the code path in detail.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? 
The more I work on this, the more interested in Web Development. Interestingly, we can do better by combining front-end languages and back-end programming. Moreover, while I was using HTML/CSS, it seemed much easier to create buttons, style the page with different colors and fonts. This project has made me realize that I can build a website with some knowledge of data structures and make it a decent website. However, I wonder if we have a good foundation of data structures can we make an excellent and complex website? For me, java was probably the primary language for a time, but I realized that I am also interested in JavaScript after working on this project.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. 
If I have more time, I will add more functions of adding sound to the game buttons. And I will switch the playing a sequence of clues depending on the game level. I will also put the game mode such as easy, medium, and complex. For the easy level: I will put the most effortless playing sequence; for medium, I will build a few complex functions; for the hard, I will put the most challenging functions. I also want to make the game for two or more human players, and it will be more fun.
