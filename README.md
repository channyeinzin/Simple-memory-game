**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Chan Nyein Zin**

Time spent: **15** hours spent in total

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions

I follow the instruction of SITE Program Pre-work from CodePath course

It is a beneficial game for beginners of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If we do not have any idea of building a small project, we should definitely try this project. The most challenging part of this program is adding sound to the game buttons, and we need to do math and physic slightly because we have to play a tone for what amount of time specifically. In this programming, I just follow the step that the code path provided to me, and I read carefully and follow the explanation from the code path. Then the next challenging part is recalling the functions within the three languages because they need to connect in this game. It was painless and smooth for me because I followed the steps of the explanation from the code path. Another challenging part was creating the gif because I had never done that before, and it took me more than an hour because I had to resize my video resolution within 10MB. I have to be patient and record multiple times. 

Web development is beneficial for us because we always ask google, safari, firefox, and any other search engine. And we can also build a game by using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. While making this game, I noticed the most important reason the frameworks exist. It can help to create a project faster and save time. But why do we use the framework, and can we do without the framework? 

If I have more time, I will add more functions of adding sound to the game buttons. And I will switch the playing a sequence of clues depending on the game level. I will also put the game mode such as easy, medium, and complex. For the easy level: I will put the most effortless playing sequence; for medium, I will build a few complex functions; for the hard, I will put the most challenging functions. I also want to make the game for two or more human players, and it will be more fun.
